# Creating Accessible Events - A How to Guide v1.0
### June 08, 2019
### By Kiran "Rin" Oliver
### Guide inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/PerrySetGo/Gender-Inclusive-Events-Guide"> Gender Inclusive Events Guide <a/> by Perry Eising

## Hello and welcome! Thank you for viewing this guide. It is still a WIP, and more pages will be added over the next few days/weeks/months.

This repo was inspired by the Gender Inclusive Events guide written by Perry Eising, referenced above. Perry is great. You should check them out <a href="https://twitter.com/perrysetgo"> on Twitter</a>.

### 1. Who this material is for
This guide is meant for people and organizations that are hosting events. In particular, tech-focused and tech-adjacent events. It is by no means meant as a hard-line ruleset.

This guide will, ideally (hopefully!), be used as a jumping off point to spark discussion within the event organizer community surrounding creating greater accessibility for event attendees that are autistic, disabled, neurodivergent, and of various body types.

### 2. Basic premises

 * Unconscious bias is real. If you don't know <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/diversity/unconscious-bias/"> what unconsicous bias is</a>, that's okay. It affects everyone, and is very important to be aware of as much as possible!

 * Including people means that they are likely to participate

 * Having accessible venues with rulesets that are supportive of those that are fat, have autism, are neurodivergent, or disabilities means that attendees are likely to speak positively about their experience, and it may encourage them to attend more events in the future

 * Understanding that what affects one autistic/disabled/nuerodivergent person may not always affect another, and even if both do experience the same symptom, they may not relate to it in the same way or experience it at the same level of distress or uncomfort

 * Body sizes vary, and the needs of those that have larger bodies versus those that are smaller must be considered

 * Invisible illnesses or injuries are real, and impact people beyond what may be visible at first glance

 * Those that are fat face very different experiences at events than those that are thin, and these needs must be considered when aiming to organize a truly accessible event space, particularly if an attendee has other axes of oppression [For example: Is also autistic, disabled, etc.]

 * Mobility concerns vary from person to person, and care should be taken to make events accessible to wide variety of individuals with varying needs.


### 3. Guide structure & Contributions
 * Different markdown files are going to be used for different aspects of the event process and/or disability in question.
 * I'd love to have more contributions to the resources! Please don't be shy!

### 5. Questions & Complaints
This is a sensitive issue, as it deals with real problems I experience every day as a person that is fat, and also has autism, and numerous invisible disabilities. I do not write on behalf of every fat, autistic person or person[s] with my particular disabilites, but the current version of this guide and the information contained in it is based off of accessibility issues I have faced personally at events.

If you have an issue with something I said here [though again, keep in mind this guide has been written based upon my own lived experiences], please get in touch with me. Open an issue or [ping me on twitter](https://twitter.com/kiran_oliver).

If you're clearly trolling or trying to get a reaction out of me, I reserve the right to not engage with you. Life is way too short to troll people. I promise.

Thank you for contributing!! Go create something amazing today!
